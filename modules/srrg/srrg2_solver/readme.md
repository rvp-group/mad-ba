Basic solver specifically designed for SLAM pipelines. Highly efficient, no fancy stuff, but man if it runs!

##### What's inside the directories?
- `srrg2_solver`: core package for the solver. use this for your SLAM pipeline, minimal dependecies.
- `srrg2_solver_gui`: requires openGL, to see what's going on under the hood [work in progress].
